# 10.Bulding_Speaker_Separation_Algorithm_Emotion_Recognition

In a conversation of two speakers there are many features, this ones contain important
information that allows to identify each speaker voice signal. The Hilbert transform and
dynamic threshold permit to build a better algorithm for prosodic silences identification and
the Fourier analysis helps to display and synthesize different signals in terms of power spectral
density distributions . Thus, through Fourier transform and the short time Fourier transform,
which build a signal spectogram, we are going to identify the prosodic silences features obtained
from the voice signal. Using these mathematical tools we made a Matlab implementation
for two voice recorders, each one with two speakers, we are going to show the results and to
conclude about this.
